# odin-landing-page

Hey look! I remembered to update the readme!

A landing page for the Odin Project. Fairly certain I remembered to copy over all of the styling specified in the attached image, so other than some spacing and sizing, the website I made should match pretty well.

I used the attached image of the desired outcome site in place of any other image so that you can compare 
it with what I made. There are two there so that I could match the spacing on the text to the left of the image with what was provided. Pretty great tool honestly to have a small reference built in honestly, and
I had the full image in a seperate tab to compare too.

Definitely not the most efficient site in the world, but from what I can tell most of the styling is unique from element to element other than font. Even though there are only a few colours, they're used on different types of elements throughout so it looks real clean but the css is sorta lengthy. I'm sure I missed a few ways to simplify this.

Overall, lotsa fun to make!
